# Make.com Build Checklist: Body Systems Assessment ‚Üí Supabase

---

## **üõ† Setup in Make.com**

- **Create new Scenario**: Name it clearly (GravityForms - Body Systems Assessment Intake)
    
- **Add Webhook Trigger**:
    
    - Create a custom webhook
        
    - Copy the webhook URL
        
    - Paste it into GravityForms Webhook Add-On settings
        
    
- **Set Webhook to POST** from GravityForms
    
- **Test webhook**: Send a test submission to capture the payload structure

## **üß© Modules to Configure**

- **JSON Parser Module** (optional but highly recommended)
    
    - Parse raw incoming webhook body for easier field mapping
        
    
- **Supabase - Create Row Module**
    
    - Connect Supabase account (if not already connected)
        
    - Target table: assessments
        
    - Map fields:
        
        - member_id (either pulled from email match or hidden field)
            
        - assessment_type ‚Üí hardcode as body_systems
            
        - adrenal_score, thyroid_score, gut_score
            
        - primary_body_system
            
        - sub_system
            
        - submitted_at ‚Üí now()

    - Example: "New Body Systems Assessment submitted for {{email}}"

## **‚ö†Ô∏è Error Handling**

- **Attach error route** from Supabase module
    
- **Slack error notification** or **Store failed submissions** (optional Make Data Store)
    
- **Set retry strategy** (optional: retry on network/server errors)
    

---

## **üîß Post-Build Sanity Checks**

- Form submission pushes **correct data** into Supabase
    
- Field mappings match GravityForms ‚Üí Supabase cleanly
    
- Slack alerts (if added) trigger on both success and error
    
- Scenario is **enabled** after testing
    
- Scenario name is clear (for future maintenance)
    
- Add brief notes to Scenario description inside Make for context
