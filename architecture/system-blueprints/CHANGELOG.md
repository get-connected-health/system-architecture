# Best Practices for Updating

- **Always add an entry** when:
  - A system blueprint materially changes
  - A Supabase table is created, altered, or versioned
  - A Make.com scenario is added, removed, or pivoted
  - New form â†’ system interactions are mapped

- **Small doc fixes** (typos, comment clarity) **do NOT need** changelog entries.

- **Link versions to Git commits** when possible in your commit messages:
  - Example commit: `blueprint: add onboarding flow v1.2a`

# ðŸ§  Future Scalability Tip

If needed later, this `CHANGELOG.md` can be machine-parsed to auto-generate **release notes** or **system update digests** for operations or support teams.
Keep it simple now â€” but it's powerful long-term.
