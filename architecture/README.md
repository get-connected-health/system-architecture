# Connected Health ‚Äî Architecture Folder

This folder contains all canonical technical documentation for how Connected Health systems work across platforms.

Unlike the previous split into `/system-blueprints/`, `/data-models/`, and `/system-logic/`, this flattened structure uses **metadata tags** in each file‚Äôs frontmatter to clearly indicate its function.

## Tag Conventions (in each file‚Äôs frontmatter)

| Tag | Purpose |
|-----|---------|
| `blueprint` | Describes platform flows, funnel logic, or automation stack |
| `data-model` | Defines table schemas, field names, and system object shapes |
| `logic` | Documents tag behavior, access rules, and workflow triggers |
| `qa` | Test procedures or validation patterns (planned) |
| `copy-logic` | Visibility conditions, module personalization rules (optional) |

Each file should include YAML frontmatter like:

```yaml

## File Inclusion Standards

- ‚úÖ Use **one document per logical unit** (don‚Äôt nest models and blueprints unless necessary)
- ‚úÖ Include all system-wide schemas, tag maps, and onboarding flows
- ‚úÖ Link out to external specs, wireframes, or Make.com scenarios as needed
- ‚ùå Do not include execution-level Zap configs, scripts, or low-level platform exports here

## Find What You Need

Use [`index.md`](./index.md) to browse and filter system artifacts by tag.

Example use cases:
- üîÅ Want to know which tag unlocks the Cleanse? ‚Üí Search for `access::unlocked::connected_cleanse`
- üß± Need the Supabase field for gut_score? ‚Üí Check `member-object-schema.md`
- üß† Looking for the full member journey map? ‚Üí See `member-journey-overview.md`
