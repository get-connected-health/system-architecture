# Documentation Standards Folder

This folder defines all **contributor standards** for working inside the `system-architecture` repository.

It acts as the source of truth for **naming conventions**, **PR practices**, **branch discipline**, and **future governance** of technical work.

---

## ðŸ“‚ Folder Structure

| File | Purpose |
|:-----|:--------|
| `branch-naming.md` | Defines naming rules for Git branches (e.g., feature/xyz, fix/abc) |
| (future) `pr-review-guidelines.md` | How to review and approve Pull Requests consistently |
| (future) `style-guide.md` | Markdown, formatting, and repo hygiene rules |

---

## ðŸ“Œ Standards

- Follow **branch naming conventions** for every Git branch.
- Complete all **PR templates** before requesting a merge into `main`.
- Update **CHANGELOG.md** when blueprints, schemas, or flow logic changes.
- Prefer **descriptive, traceable commits** over "quick fix" messages.
