# Contributing to Connected Health
Welcome â€” and thank you for collaborating with the Connected Health development team. This guide outlines how to contribute effectively and responsibly to this repository.

---

## Pull Request Process
1. **Branch from**: `main`
2. **Use clear branch naming**:
   ```
   feature/[short-name]
   bugfix/[short-name]
   hotfix/[ticket-or-date]
   ```
3. **Write clean commits**:
   ```
   feat: add webhook validation logic
   fix: correct field map typos
   ```
4. **Submit a pull request**:
   - PRs must pass CODEOWNERS review before merge
   - Do not merge your own PR â€” wait for approval

---

## Testing Requirements

- Run all test workflows (e.g. Make, webhook simulation) before opening PRs
- QA team must verify integration functionality if your PR affects logic flow
- Functional test > unit test â€” this is a low-code integration repo
